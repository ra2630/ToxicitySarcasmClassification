We propose an end-to-end model based on convolution and recurrent neural network natural language models to address the task of classifying text as sarcastic, toxic or regular. We propose an ensemble model based of Convolution Networks, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells coupled with attention layer and Multi Layer Perceptron with features extracted manually to enhance performance. We train our model on the combined toxicity dataset from Kaggle, and Sarcasm dataset from news headlines also published on Kaggle.
